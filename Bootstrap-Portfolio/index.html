            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            <img id="MyPicture" src="assets/images/1ce6896.jpg" alt="Picture of Me">Lifelong learning is very important to me. So, I'm learning about full stack development. I've always liked programming in school and I did some in my early career as an IT shadow. An IT shadow, by the way, is a person who does IT work but doesn't work for IT. It was fun. I built applications in Focus, Microsoft Access, and even Lotus Notes.
            </p>
            <p>
            I went to and graduated from Rollins College with a BA in Computer Science. I chose a liberal arts school because I did not want a purely technical education. While I liked programming, I really liked understanding the technical and being able to communicate this to the non-technical. My early 'IT' role outside of IT gave me this insight and my career has run along this same path working between IT and the business. My strength has been in translating business desires into functional system requirements. With more experience, I've transitioned into a role of Project Manager and I've had my Project Management Professional certification from PMI now for several years.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Recently, the world of agile project development became an option and I love it. Although my current environment does not benefit fully from agile development, I still pursue what of it I can. One thing I really like about software development with agile is that the teams can be - should be - diverse and every member should have the chance to try on different hats. That is different from a waterfall project management methodology where every specific resource is identified with a specific function and only that function.
            </p>  
            <p>
            Full stack development appeals to me because you can wear different hats and there seems so much to learn - with the many tools, techniques, and methods. Right now its organized chaos but with the right framework I'll be able to learn a little about many different things and come back to learn much about a few.
